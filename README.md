### Update for Assignment Due 4-4-2014

* This starts up the application by creating a home page and places each coaster on home page with their name and     location.
* This also has a show page which shows a description and a picture as well as everything else shown on the index page.

To use just create a coaster and place details in it.

Also have session controller, just haven't implemented sessions yet...
